## Gameplay overview
Players start by building a *Command Post*, which must defend from waves of incoming enemies, and then deploy turrets that attack enemies at sight. There's a 30-second intermission before each next wave, during which players can deploy more turrets and repair/upgrade existing ones, using currency earned while playing.

There's a total of 25 waves. Every 5th wave is a Boss Wave, and every 3rd consecutive wave is a Bonus Wave. Boss Waves include a randomised Boss amongst other enemies, Bonus Waves reward players if they accomplish the bonus objective.
